AB  - Primary renal neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are exceedingly rare with roughly 100 
      reported cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of 
      a primary renal NET with inferior vena caval tumor thrombus. The uniqueness of
      this case is highlighted by the degree to which vascular invasion occurred.
